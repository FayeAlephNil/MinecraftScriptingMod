# MinecraftScriptingMod
The goal of MinecraftScriptingMod (Abbreviated MCSM) is to be able to script Minecraft in languages other than Java.
## Test Scripts
These are scripts used in testing. Because the .gitignore blanket-ignores all files in the /eclipse directory, we have these placed elsewhere. To use them, simply copy over the contents of the /testscripts folder to the /eclipse/mcsm-scripts folder.
